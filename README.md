# Project Setup

Follow these steps to successfully run the Yoga project from the Git repository.

**Prerequisites:**

**1. Install Docker and Docker Compose**

Docker and Docker Compose are required to run this project. Follow the official installation instructions based on your operating system:

- Docker: Install Docker
- Docker Compose: Install Docker Compose (if not included with Docker)

  Note: After installing Docker, make sure Docker is running. You can verify by running:
  
       docker --version
       docker-compose --version

# Steps to Run the Project

**1. Clone the Repository**

Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub:

      git clone https://github.com/noateomi/Yoga.git
      cd Yoga

**2. Build and Run the Docker Containers**

Run the following command to build and start the containers:

      docker-compose up -d --build

This will:

- Build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile.
- Start the web and nginx services defined in docker-compose.yml.

**3. Load Initial Data for Yoga Poses**

To load sample data (including images) into your database, run the following command:

      docker-compose exec web python Yoga/manage.py loaddata /app/Yoga/yoga_poses_fixture.json 

This command loads initial data for the YogaPose model to ensure the app displays sample yoga poses.

**4. Access the Application**

Once everything is set up, access the application by opening a browser and going to:

     http://localhost:8080

- The application will be accessible on port 8080, with Nginx as the reverse proxy.
- The web service serves the Django application, and nginx serves static files.

**5. Stopping the Application**

To stop the running containers, use:

      docker-compose down
